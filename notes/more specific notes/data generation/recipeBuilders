____________________________________________________________________________|

1)
    ShapelessRecipeBuilder.shapeless(RecipeCategory, result) // the result item
        .requires(ItemLike) // what is required?
        .unlockedBy(String, Criteria) // the criteria to unlock the recipe in survival game
        .save(consumer); // always save consumer (dunno why)

2)
    ShapedRecipeBuilder.shaped(RecipeCategory.MISC, result)
        .pattern("BBB")
        .pattern("BBB")
        .pattern("BBB") // Create recipe pattern
        .define('B', ItemLike) // Define what the symbol represents
        .unlockedBy("criteria", criteria) // the criteria to unlock the recipe in survival game
        .save(consumer); // always save consumer (dunno why)

More detailed explanation

    ShapelessRecipeBuilder.java -> building anything without a strict rule that defines the order in which items should be placed in the Crafting Table
    ShapedRecipeBuilder.java -> building anything with specific order in which the Items/Blocks should be placed in Crafting Table

    1) shapeless(RecipeCategory, ItemLike)
        - RecipeCategory -> the RecipeCategory enum constant
        - ItemLike -> the RESULT product of the recipe (i.e. which item/block will we get after executing this recipe?)
        * arg2 is the ItemLike interface that is being implemented by both Block.java and Item.java

    2) requires(ItemLike) - which item is required for building?

    3) unlockedBy(String, Criteria)
        When only starting the survival world the player does not have recipes for all items in the game.
        However, he unlocks more recipes throughout the game progression
        For example, when getting a wood first time, the wood items' recipes are unlocked

            - unlockedBy(String, Criteria) requires argument which is a criteria (condition) for a recipe to be unlocked
