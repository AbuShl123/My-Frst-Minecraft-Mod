To start with:

    1. Download already prepared framework with one ExampleMod.java file (Forge)
    2. This is a gradle project. Execute Gradle Reload command
    3. Remove all comments in ExampleMod class and remove all items and blocks
    4. Methods commonSetup() and addCreative() along with the contents of constructor (except those that give error) should be remained
    5. You can rename the java class file.
    6. Change MOI_ID to your preferred value.
    7. Execute Gradle Tasks -> forgegradle runs -> genIntellijRuns
    8. Now you may start the "runClient" run configuration to open the minecraft!

Important notes:

    <!> MODID can only be lowercase and may contain only numbers, dashes and underscores
        !!no white spaces and any other special characters!!

    <!> Once you are done with your scripts, you may share your mod as a .jar file with other people or post it in the internet for others to use

            To do this:
                1. execute gradle './gradlew build' command in the terminal from project level
                2. navigate to ./build/libs/<projectName>.jar file
                3. Use this .jar file as it is your mode file.

            You may then paste this file under 'mods' folder in %appdata%/.minecraft location
