Items and how to add custom items	
_______________________________________________________________________________

	What are items in the game?
	
		- Items are different from blocks
		  They cannot be placed somewhere as an interactable object 
		  Examples of items: apples, diamonds, swords etc


	<!!!> All items are located under ModItems.java file
	<!!!> Each item is an instance stored in the static field 
	<!!!> MOD_ID class - is the class where the MOD_ID is defined (basically the main class) 


	What are the items in the framework? 
	
		- The items in the framework are simple Item.java objects
		  However the process of adding the item to the game is a bit complicated  
		  
		  
	IMPORTANT: 
		
		Each Item or Block in Minecraft has a NAME 
		For example in the command: 
			/give @s minecraft:iron_pickaxe 
		the "iron_pickaxe" is the name of Iron Pickaxe used across the framework

	How to create items: 
	
		<!!!> Creating the instance of Item.java is not enough to add this to the game 
		
		1. Create ModItems.java class --> here we will store all mod items 
		
		2. RegistryObject<T>.java 
			
			RegistryObject is a class that stores the Item or Block instnace depending on what you have provided for the generic
			
			However you cannot create the object of RegistryObject class directly. 
			For this the DeferredRegister is used. 
	
		3. DeferredRegister<T>.java
				
			1) Use Item.java as a generic to register the item
			2) Use Block.java as a generic to register the block 
							
			Methods: 
				static register(...) {...}
					- returns the RegistryObject instance with the generic of T type. 
					- accepts arguments: 
						1) String name ----> refer to line 26
						2) Supplier to supply the actual instance of Item 
						
		
		4. IEventBus
			
			1) By using DeferredRegister register the instance of IEventBus
			2) However the instanace of IEventBus is stored in the constructor of the MOD_ID class 
				--> pass that instnace to register it 
		
		5. Finally to add the item to creative mod tab use addCreative() method within MOD_ID class
