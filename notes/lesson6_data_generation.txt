Data generation	|
________________| 

Вот это вот действительно сложно...


	In order to make our lives easier we may create a datagen classes that will literally write json files for us 
	So far we were writing json files by ourselves which was a tedious job
	However, now we may use specific classes that will automate these steps 
	
	
	1) Data generation is basically the automation of json files creation 
	
	2) all data gen. classes are locates under src/main/java/net/abushl123/tutorialmod/datagen package 
	
	3) In the end of the work, once generator classes are done, run RunData run configuration for json files to appear 
		All json files will appear under src/generated [main] package 
		Remove duplicated files that were before created under src/main/resources package
