Data generation	|
________________| 

Вот это вот действительно сложно...


	In order to make our lives easier we may create a datagen classes that will literally write json files for us 
	So far we were writing json files by ourselves which was a tedious job
	However, now we may use specific classes that will automate these steps 
	
	
	1) Data generation is basically the automation of json files creation 
	
	2) All data gen. classes are locates under src/main/java/net/abushl123/tutorialmod/datagen package
	
	3) In the end of the work, once generator classes are done, run RunData run configuration for json files to appear
	   All json files will appear under src/generated [main] package
	   Remove duplicated files that were before created under src/main/resources package
	
	
	<!> Interesting fact: To create a world generator, we also use json files

Generator Classes
________________________________________
    </> DataGenerators.java <--

            For different purposes various "Provider" classes should be written.
            Each of those classes are specific generators that will create corresponding JSON files

            1. All generator classes should be instantiated in DataGenerators.java file


    </> ModRecipeProvider.java <--

            This generator created json files for recipes in minecraft.
            We can use multiple builders that may help us to register the recipes.

            1. Extends RecipeProvider abstract class and implements IConditionBuilder interface.
            2. All recipes are written inside buildRecipes() method which is overriden from RecipeProvider abstract class
