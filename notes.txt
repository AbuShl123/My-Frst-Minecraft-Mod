Important notes about programming minecraft modifications:

    MODID can only be lowercase and may contain only numbers, dashes and underscores
        !!no white spaces and any other special characters!!

    Once you have done with your scripts, you may share your mod as a .jar application file with other people or post it in the internet for others to use!

        To do this:
            1. execute gradle './gradlew build' command in the terminal from project level
            2. navigate to ./build/libs/<projectName>.jar file
            3. Use this .jar file as it is your mode file.

        You may then paste this file under 'mods' folder in %appdata%/.minecraft location
